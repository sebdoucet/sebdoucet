I'm Seb working as a Tech Lead in the gamming industry. Pationnate by the web technologies and even more since folks at Microsoft invented Typescript. I'm also into backend using netcore on distributed architecture. Lot of my personnal project have been inspired by the Net Framework sources, Roslyn, Typescript compiler, VSCode sources which I'm in love with the work they've done on each of these project.

 🔭 I’m currently working on Aster.js projects, the goal final goal is to unify the overall communication between backend / frontend / workers / browser to browser / etc through asynchronous events base comunications.

 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on all Aster.js project.
